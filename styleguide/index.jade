          h3 Components
          p.
            All the usual components needed on any given conference site are listed here.
            Each component is shown independent of location and context,
            apart from other components and apart from its usual position on a site page.
            #[strong This is #[em not] meant to be a page mockup or wireframe.]
            It is simply used by developers to organize components into logical groupings
            and to see what they look like out of context.
          p.
            There are two general types of components: typographical components and
            UI components.
          p.
            #[strong Note:] On these pages, each component demo will be placed in a
            #[code &lt;figure&gt;] element to separate it from the surrounding content.

            h4: a(href="comp-typo.html") Typographical Components
            p.
              These are of a static nature and consist
              mainly of textual content. There is little to no user interaction required.
              Examples include kinds of boxes or sections that contain descriptions, and
              inline-level elements such as dates and places.

            h4: a(href="comp-ui.html") UI (user-interactive) Components
            p.
              These are the dynamic bells-and-whistles
              that make a webpage pop. These are things that users are likely to interact
              with, such as alerts, labels, navigation, and buttons.
              Specially-styled (not default) form elements also go in this category.
              Not all of these must be interactive, though. Some UI components can
              just sit there and look pretty (like an icon or badge).
